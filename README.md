This project provides 3D-printable adapters to mount lenses from vintage cameras onto modern digital cameras.

## Disclaimer

Modifying cameras and lenses is an inherently risky process. The author of this project is not responsible for any damage to your equipment. Please proceed at your own risk.

## How it Works

The process generally involves three steps:

1.  **Harvesting the lens:** Carefully remove the lens from a vintage, non-interchangeable lens camera. This process is typically reversible.
2.  **3D Printing the adapter:** Print the adapter parts using the provided design files.
3.  **Assembly:** Assemble the lens and adapter, and mount it on a modern mirrorless camera.

## Models

This repository contains adapters for the following camera models:

*   **Kodak Instamatic 250**
*   **Kodak Instamatic 500**
*   **Kodak Retinette 1A**
*   **Kodak Retina Automatic III**
*   **Kodak Retina Reflex**
*   **Rollei SL26**: This adapter is for Rollei's SL26 126 camera, which features a 40mm f/2.8 Tessar, 28mm f/3.2 Pro-Tessar, and 80mm f/4 Pro-Tessar lens. The adapter consists of two parts: a main body and a protective ring.
*   **Voigtlander Vito Automatic I**: This camera is equipped with a Voigtlander Lanthar 50mm f/2.8 lens.
*   **Voigtlander Vito CL**, see source file on [OnShape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/57f2480a93832a109099d55a/w/df74b5b7506d357abf5b014f/e/bfa8caa6a3f07ffc7120eeaa)
*   **Voigtlander Vito II**
*   **Voigtlander Vito IIa**
*   **Zeiss Ikon Contessamat SE**
*   **Zeiss Ikon Contina II 524/24**
*   **Zeiss Ikon Continett**, see source file on [OnShape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/583d811fd88ef310519165ff/w/01c7d7b396e07274ab123d07/e/6638b648352ce127879f8541?renderMode=0&uiState=68a7bfe35242834763591b9f)

Each camera model has a dedicated subfolder containing the necessary design files and a `README.md` with specific instructions.

## Printing

### Material Recommendation

For the main adapter body, a matte black filament is recommended to minimize internal reflections. Alternatively, you can paint the interior of the adapter with matte black paint to reduce reflections.

Over the years, I have experimented with various materials, including generic PLA, carbon-fiber reinforced PLA (PLA-CF), carbon-fiber reinforced PA6 (Nylon), and matte PETG HF. PLA-CF is easy to print, offers low luster, and provides good strength, but has a low heat-deflection temperature. If your printer supports it, PA6-CF is the best overall choice.

Protective rings, if included in the design, can be printed in any color.

### Print Settings

General print settings are provided in the `README.md` file within each camera's subfolder.

## About the Author
This project was started by Aaron Zhang in 2015 to make vintage lens adaptation more accessible and to salvage vintage cameras that might otherwise end up in a landfill. For me, this project is also a form of meditation.
