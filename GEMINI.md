## Introduction
Since 2015 I have been working on designing some camera lens adapters. One can harvest (by removing, mostly reversable) the lens on vintage, non-interchangeable lens cameras, install to the adapter, then use on modern mirrorless cameras. These adapters are usually 3D-printed (using FDM/FFF) with some off-the-shelf parts.


## Share on Github
I plan to release all design files on github, so people can download and make their own adapters.

I'd also like to add sections on printing material recommendation, print settings etc.

## Folder structure and files
The README of the root should have all related sections with brief introductionof each adapter and accesories.

Each subfolder contains files for a specific camera, with the name of the folder being the camera itself. The README in each subfolder acts as an instruction of the make process.

## Goal
My goal of this project was initially to make it a profitable business. Over the years I did sell some modified lens and had over $1000 in income. However I found the market to be very small.

Now I plan to open-source the design, and make it more accesible to other people. The goal is to build my track record in the open source community, and also to show my competence as an engineer.
